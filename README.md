Simple Python logger!

Here's all that's needed to create your log:

Message string: whatever you want your log to say
Name: Name of the log file you want to use (automatically concatinated with "_update_log_{date})"
Log_Path: The path to the directory where you want to store your logs. The logger automatically creates a new folder for the day the logs are generated if one does not yet exist, adding some built-in organization.
